      <h2>Mockups from previous assessment</h2>
      <p>For developing these mockup, i got feedback from my friends and re-design some parts according to feedback</p>
      <h3>This is final prototype</h3>
      <a href="https://repl.it/join/vagadbow-avelyn">NBCF</a>
      <div class="home"></br>
        <h2>Main page</h2>
        <figure><img src="hifi/home.png" alt=""></figure>
        <p>For main page, it looks quite messy and pointless with stories by patients and messages from NBCF. it is better to emphasize main message or picutes that what NBCF would like to show to users. I have to change hierarchy and restructured website.</p>
        <figure><img src="iteration/Home.png" alt=""></figure>
      </div>
      <div class="research">
        <h2>Research page</h2>
        <figure><img src="hifi/research.png" alt=""></figure>
        <p>For research part, rather than showing researches individually in main landing page for research. It is better to show 4 main contents and brief explanations for each researches. If users would like to know more about one of research. they can choose one and go further pages for specific detail</p>
        <figure><img src="iteration/research.png" alt=""></figure>

      </div>
      <div class="donation">
        <h2>Donation page</h2>
        <figure><img src="hifi/donation.png" alt=""></figure>
       <figure> <img src="hifi/donation1.png" alt=""></figure>
        <p>Donation part and fundraise parts are overlapping such as celebration or challenge. Therefore, i decided to merge those two parts and focus on how to donate. Moreover, design structure has to be consistent.</p>
        <figure><img src="iteration/donation.png" alt=""></figure>
      </div>
      <div class="fund">
        <h2>Fund page</h2>
         <figure><img src="hifi/fund.png" alt=""></figure>
         <p>There are too much different layour styles and hierarchy. consistency and similar structures are helpful to make user to understand contents easily. Therefore, I decided to change design structures as same as research part. when users put mouse point on top of pictures, they can get clues. </p>
        <figure><img src="iteration/fund.png" alt=""></figure> 
      </div>
      <div class="final">
        <h2></h2>
      </div>

		
		</section>
		<section id="Final prototype">
      <div class="final">
        <a href="https://final-a5-for-deco1016.avelyn.repl.co/index.html"><h1>Final prototype</h1></a></br>
        <h2>Main home page</h2>
        <figure><img src="a5pic/home.png"  alt=""></figure>
        <p>In maing home page, users can see the messages "This is what we are up against and the figures from NBCF how many australian gets breaste cancer or how many people are dying from cancer. I used pink gradient background following feedback that final mockup version was too bright and the color choices werer too same as original NBCF website. Therefore, I tried other colors and contrasting color which can easily see among brigt pink graident color. Navigation bar is located on top of website that users can easily move to other pages. Logo with name is linked to main page, so users can go back to main page easily with clicking. Rather than using icons, i used "Research","Fundraise" and "Donation" because the project is mainly focused on desktop version and I thought that using icons for those buttons would not help users to understand. Bottom layout shows the pictures by patients who were suffering from breast cancer or people who donated to National Breast Cancer foundation. It used slide functions to show each person's details when user pressed arrow on middle left or right of picture. when users would like to see their story, they need to press button "her story" to see specifically. My first plan was showing users short messages or introduction of the patients or donors, however I got feedbacks that those short messages are quite distracting to see pictures and look messy. Therefore, i deleted those part and only shows their name and the date they diagnosed. Footers are organized with copyright explanation by NBCF and social media links with icons which users can obviously predict. Also, those icons are linked to actual NBCF original pages. Background colour and font colours are contrasted. I used pink gredient colour for background due to pink symbolizes breast cancer foundation. White and yellow or greyish blue colours which help users to reconize easily.</p>
        <p>For mobile version, I got feedback that make contents drop vertically to increase legibility. also there are hover effect on the navigation bar to make user to indicate easily.</p>
        <figure><img src="mobile/home.png" alt=""></figure>
        <figure><img src="a5pic/research.png"alt=""></figure>
        <p>research part had bunch of changes. when users put mouse point over pictures, by hover effect, users can see the short descriptions of the chosen part. First design was planned to show all details and contents in one page, but the structure was quite messy and users might feel confused and some contents are unnecessary for them. Moreover, I would like to give more freedom to users to decide to see the page if they wish to know more rather than forcing them to see all contents in one page.</p>
        <p>Moreover, increasing design consistency, the layout is same as iteration and flex-direction is column in mobile version to allow users to read contents simply scrolling pages</p>
        <figure><img src="mobile/research.png" alt=""></figure>
        <h2>Fundraise</h2>
        <figure><img src="a5pic/fund.png" alt=""></figure>
        <p>fundraising part used same layout as the research part in order to keep deisgn consistency and users do not get confused due to new layout and structures. Hover effects are used for each content to let users see contents briefly for reducing the messiness in one screen.</p>
        <figure><img src="mobile/fund.png" alt=""></figure>
        <h2>Donation</h2>
        <figure><img src="a5pic/donation.png" alt=""></figure>
        <p>Donation part is devided to two column to make form more recognisable and distict. Users can type their personal details, set the amount of money to donate and  can put their payment details. Hierarchy is centered and stacked sentence that users can read veritically which can support legibilty </p>
        <figure><img src="mobile/donation.png" alt=""></figure>
